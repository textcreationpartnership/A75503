            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The INTRODUCTION to the ApologiÅ¿t's Conflict with the Reflector.</head>
            <p>'TIS expedient the Reader underÅ¿tand, That the Pamphlet, bearing the Title of, <hi>ObÅ¿ervations on Mr.</hi> Walker<hi>'s Account of the Siege of</hi> Derry; this I am now to Examine; and that Sheet Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted againÅ¿t Mr. <hi>Osborn</hi>'s Vindication, are all three the Births of the Å¿ame Brain, level'd at the Å¿ame (general) Å¿cope, ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated by the Å¿ame Genius, deliver'd in the Å¿ame Strain and Style. In thoÅ¿e ObÅ¿ervations are as many obÅ¿ervable PaÅ¿Å¿ages as Periods, in Å¿pecial, two, which, for the courage of an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ervator, may vie with Sir <hi>Roger</hi> himÅ¿elf. One is the Harangue he beÅ¿tows chiefly on Mr. <hi>Os. p. 6, 7, 8.</hi> This has run the Gaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let in Mr. <hi>Osborn</hi>'s Vindication, and Å¿o I wave it. The other is in <hi>p. 5.</hi> where the ObÅ¿ervator celebrates His MajeÅ¿ty's Bounty to Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> in theÅ¿e words; â <hi>And howÅ¿oever the Sum (I Å¿uppoÅ¿e of 5000.</hi> 
               <abbr>l.</abbr> 
               <hi>may bear the Å¿hew of a Reward pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionate to his</hi> (i. e.) <hi>Mr.</hi> Walker<hi>'s Service; I dare aver, it is far Å¿hort of his very Sufferings, and will not reach to the refunding of what he has loÅ¿t in his HouÅ¿es and PerÅ¿onal EÅ¿tate, by Fire, Plunder, and other Outrages done by his and our implacable Enemies.</hi> I quote theÅ¿e PaÅ¿Å¿ages to move the Reader to condole at leaÅ¿t, my pitiable Fate, in being Å¿o unequally match'd with a Champion, of whoÅ¿e invincible ProweÅ¿s theÅ¿e two freÅ¿h inÅ¿tances are alone a Å¿ufficient demonÅ¿tration: Do therefore expect my Judges will do me the JuÅ¿tice, <hi>Minos,</hi> Å¿itting on the Infernal Bench, did <hi>Hannibal,</hi> that they paÅ¿s the ApologiÅ¿t for a Man, and of Å¿ome Metal too, tho' he Å¿hould be foil'd (which <hi>Hercules</hi> forbid) by a Combatant, whoÅ¿e bare averment will paÅ¿s <hi>500 <abbr>l.</abbr>
               </hi> or a much Å¿maller Sum, for greater weight and value than <hi>5000</hi> 
               <abbr>l.</abbr> of the beÅ¿t Coin in our King's Exchequer; and with a few Å¿quirts of his Pen can make whole Legions of pragmatical, perverÅ¿e, murmuring<note n="*" place="margin">ObÅ¿erva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <hi>p.</hi> 3, 4, 6.</note>, malignant Spirits Å¿cut it away to the Boreal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions, faÅ¿ter than <hi>Tobit</hi>'s Powder could the cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardly Hobgoblins to their inviÅ¿ible Cells. But adieu, Elfs and Hobgoblins, Narrators and Vindicators, I'm reÅ¿olv'd I'le have one bruÅ¿h with Mr. <hi>Walker</hi>'s late <hi>Lyncean</hi> ObÅ¿ervator (now contemptuous Reflector, and again, the <hi>Greek</hi> Calends, the Church and States Champion and Orator.) Come ye Sons of <hi>Mars,</hi> behold Å¿uch a bloody Duel between the Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor and ApologiÅ¿t, as <hi>Homer,</hi> till he loÅ¿t his Eyes, never Å¿aw between Mice and Frogs, the <hi>Thracian</hi> Cranes and <hi>Indian</hi> Pigmies. The Reflector indeed makes his approaches Å¿omewhat Comically, but you may in fine perhaps Å¿ee his Tragical CaÅ¿tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phe. After his little SkirmiÅ¿h with the Legions before mention'd, he tells you, he had a great Conflict with himÅ¿elf, <hi>i. e.</hi> between his Will and <g ref="char:V">Æ²</g>nderÅ¿tanding; whether he Å¿hould think firÅ¿t, and then Å¿cribble; or Å¿cribble firÅ¿t, and think after; but his Will being too Å¿trong for his ReaÅ¿on, Å¿ets him on Å¿cribling an hour, ay, a week, Learned AnimadverÅ¿ions on the Apology for Mr. <hi>Walker.</hi> And did he not Å¿cribble to good purpoÅ¿e? Yes, Å¿urely; for 'tis, Å¿ays he, a trifling Pamphlet, an immethodical Rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ody, of Vapour, Banter, Fallacy, Equivocations, idle, imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, incoherent Å¿tuff, the Å¿tyle flat and ruÅ¿tick â a thing that deÅ¿erves no ConÅ¿ideration, needs no AnÅ¿wer. Thus in his firÅ¿t Paragraph he gives his Opinion of the Apology: On the ApologiÅ¿t he beÅ¿tows the gentile Epithets and Appellations of rude, irrational, Å¿piteful, phlegmatick, Hypocrite, Å¿narler, invidious, malicious Querent, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And in his ConcluÅ¿ion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commends to him <hi>Achitophel</hi>'s ReÅ¿olution, <hi>i. e.</hi> to hang himÅ¿elf<note n="*" place="margin">Vide the laÅ¿t Period in his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections.</note>. TheÅ¿e are the Embroideries of this MaÅ¿ter-piece of the Reflector's Art. I had thought BiÅ¿hop <hi>Montague,</hi> Mr. (Å¿ince Dean) <hi>Pierce,</hi> Dr. <hi>Heylin,</hi> and to name no more, Dr. <hi>Parker,</hi> late BiÅ¿hop of <hi>Oxford,</hi> all pretending themÅ¿elves Champions for our Church, as this Gentleman does, had Å¿o much prejudic'd their own, Å¿o much advantag'd their AdverÅ¿aries CauÅ¿e by this illiberal Method of managing Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verÅ¿ie, that no <hi>EngliÅ¿h</hi> ProteÅ¿tant would ever write after their Copy.

Another reply'd, There was no need of aÅ¿Å¿igning Å¿o Å¿enÅ¿ible an action to CauÅ¿es Å¿o very remote, and unÅ¿een; that the Animal part proving too hard for the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional, or (as he leÅ¿s civilly expreÅ¿t it.) the HorÅ¿e for the Rider, has often produc'd Effects more repugnant to ReaÅ¿on, than his Scribling could appear to be to the Reflector's Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination in that Conflict with himÅ¿elf whereof this is the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentous iÅ¿Å¿ue. A Second would have it, that his Credit was extreamly Å¿unk by thoÅ¿e before-mentioned, unhappily miÅ¿adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd ObÅ¿ervations, by which Mr. <hi>Wr</hi>'s Favour was like to turn into a laÅ¿ting feud; that the only way to retrieve both, was to blaÅ¿t the Credit of the Apology, as it had done that Account, call'd Mr. <hi>Wr</hi>'s. A Third affirm'd this End not to be the End really deÅ¿ign'd by the Reflector, who never eÅ¿Å¿ays directly to confute, on the contrary, Å¿trongly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms the Apology: And as oft as he Å¿tumbles on any truth of a manly Complexion, which Å¿ometimes happens in his Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, improves it in favour of the ApologiÅ¿t; but whenever he catches any thing of a contrary Genius (in which he has ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable SucceÅ¿s) he indeed makes it Å¿imper, or as himÅ¿elf has it, caÅ¿t a tacit glance on Mr. <hi>Walker,</hi> but in fine, renders it the ApologiÅ¿ts faithful Servant. But I, who will be Å¿ure ever hereafter to help the Reflector at a dead lift, gravely admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niÅ¿h'd them of their inadvertency, told 'em he had given the ReaÅ¿ons of his Scribling in his firÅ¿t Paragraph, where he Å¿o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly proteÅ¿ts, 'twas becauÅ¿e he would interpoÅ¿e for the Honour of the King, Council, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Å¿o rudely, maliciouÅ¿ly, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> treated by the ApologiÅ¿t. A Fourth roundly averr'd, whatever So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity there might be in the Reflector's ProteÅ¿tation, there was not one grain weight of Sincerity in the ProteÅ¿tor, or Truth in the ProteÅ¿tation; Å¿ince his loÅ¿t Labour is beÅ¿tow'd to Å¿upport the tottering Credit of Mr. <hi>Walker</hi>'s Narrative, and as all that read not the Apology with a diÅ¿loyal Eye, own the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logiÅ¿t's Ardent Zeal for the Honour and IntereÅ¿t of the King and Government, Å¿o the Reflector himÅ¿elf acquits him of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teÅ¿table Crime of DiÅ¿loyalty, though it coÅ¿t the Reflector very dear, no leÅ¿s than the reverÅ¿e in fine, of the principal part of what he Å¿o Solemnly proteÅ¿ted in front; that therefore the true ReaÅ¿on was, the Panic but juÅ¿t fear that Å¿eized the Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, that as Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> for his Å¿uppos'd good Service, had receiv'd the thanks of the Honourable HouÅ¿e of Commons now Å¿itting, Å¿o his ObÅ¿ervator might receive upon his Marrow-bones the Reprimand of the Å¿ame HouÅ¿e, if no Å¿everer PuniÅ¿hment, for his very rude, moÅ¿t irrational Reflection on His MajeÅ¿ty's Princely, unparallel'd Bounty to Mr. <hi>Walker,</hi> that every good Subject would applaud the JuÅ¿tice done to the one, as the Honour done to the other; that there is an inÅ¿tance of Å¿uch JuÅ¿tice, of about Ten Years date, where the Crime was not attended with the Tith of the aggravating CircumÅ¿tances that Å¿urround this of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

What! an Apology for Mr. <hi>Walker</hi>'s failures; all ReaÅ¿on in the World Mr. <hi>Walker</hi>'s ApologiÅ¿t Å¿hould bear the chief part of the MiÅ¿priÅ¿ons, MiÅ¿demeanors, FalÅ¿hoods, Fop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peries, Failures charg'd on Mr. <hi>Walker</hi>'s ObÅ¿ervator too; for he can better bear both, than the poor ObÅ¿ervator can bear ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Now, I confeÅ¿s I find in my Å¿elf a greater propenÅ¿ion to pity than proÅ¿ecute him in his DiÅ¿treÅ¿s, Å¿ince I find him as ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous (when he deÅ¿cends to particular Articles) in acquitting me, as he was temerarious (in his general Charge) in Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaching me of thoÅ¿e Crimes whereof he knew me to be purely innocent. A Fifth bid me conÅ¿ider, that Charity begins at home; and that I muÅ¿t firÅ¿t purge my Å¿elf, then pity my Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿er; that the Reflector had obÅ¿erv'd <hi>Machiavel</hi>'s Maxim, <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniare fortiter;</hi> that my Å¿ilence to Å¿o high an Impeachment of no body knows what, againÅ¿t my Soverain, would be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted a tacit ConfeÅ¿Å¿ion of Guilt; that if the Charge were true, the ApologiÅ¿t deÅ¿erv'd no Vulgar ChaÅ¿tiÅ¿ement; but if falÅ¿e (which he did not doubt of) and the Reflector being conÅ¿cious of it, deÅ¿erv'd the PuniÅ¿hment due to Å¿uch Crimes: Yet ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis'd me to acquieÅ¿ce in that in Å¿omewhat a diÅ¿parallel CaÅ¿e in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted by <hi>Apollo</hi> on <hi>CaÅ¿Å¿andra,</hi> (which he was Å¿ure would prove the leaÅ¿t of the Reflector's Doom,) <hi>i. e.</hi> never to be cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited when he avouches truth, who Å¿o Å¿trenuouÅ¿ly avers and proteÅ¿ts what he knows, and in fine, declares to be a â Mean while (Å¿ays the Gentleman) the ApologiÅ¿t's preÅ¿ent Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince is, to Vindicate the Apology from the imputation of fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hood, and himÅ¿elf from the charge of MiÅ¿demeanor towards the Government, both which will be abundantly perform'd by directing the Reader to thoÅ¿e paÅ¿Å¿ages in the Apology which the Reflector pretends to Animadvert upon; and to explain, not the Text, but the Reflector's Comment upon it. I confeÅ¿s this Gentleman's Å¿entiments are Å¿o much my own on this Subject, that I am reÅ¿olv'd to follow ReligiouÅ¿ly his Directions, having firÅ¿t declar'd (for I'le have a care of bold Averments, and Å¿o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn ProteÅ¿tations, except againÅ¿t the Solemn League and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, Popery, Presbytery, and all other deadly Å¿in) that I would not have drawn my Dagger at this time upon the naked Reflector, if he had not charg'd me with High MiÅ¿demeanors towards my Sacred Soveraign and the Government; Crimes I more deteÅ¿t than any I have now proteÅ¿ted againÅ¿t, the Solemn League it Å¿elf not excepted; Å¿hall therefore purge my Å¿elf of 'em, and in this Paper PreÅ¿ent the Reflector with a DoÅ¿e of the Pills I have taken, which if it Å¿cour not all his three Ventricles, and the Gun-Room too, I Å¿hall conclude him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feÅ¿ted with that Malady, which nothing but the Hellebore of <hi>Anticyra</hi> effectually Cures.

            <p>THE grand, and Å¿ole Charge (whereof the Reflector eÅ¿Å¿ays to give Proof) againÅ¿t the Apology, is leeÅ¿ing-making, <hi>i. e.</hi> telling of Lies, which in <hi>Scotland</hi> being made TreaÅ¿on, 'tis the ApologiÅ¿t's Mercy his Tryal is at an <hi>EngliÅ¿h</hi> Bar. Two InÅ¿tances hereof are quoted with hideous Out-cry: One in <hi>pag.</hi> 4. of the Apology, reÅ¿pects <hi>David Cairns,</hi> EÅ¿quire; the other in <hi>pag.</hi> 23. the Arch-BiÅ¿hop of <hi>Dublin.</hi> To both in general, I Å¿ay, there is not a Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable of either in the Original Copy of the Apology, which is yet extant, and whence the Printed Copy was taken. To the latter I Å¿hall AnÅ¿wer anon in due place: The former in <hi>pag.</hi> 4. Argument Fourth, runs thus [in Å¿pecial CounÅ¿ellor <hi>Cairns,</hi> who declar'd for the then Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> and the ProteÅ¿tant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; who form'd the Multitude into Companies, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter locking the Gates.] The Å¿tyle as well as matter of theÅ¿e words, with the exact antitheÅ¿is in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, and fore-going parts of that Paragraph (theÅ¿e words excluded) may convince any Judicious Reader, they were inÅ¿erted by a different hand. Not the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman to whom the Apology was directed, not the Book-Å¿eller, nor the Printer, and leaÅ¿t of all Mr. <hi>Cairns,</hi> to whoÅ¿e Style and SenÅ¿e they bear no Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy, who is much a Sufferer by them, though he knew nothing of 'em before he had it from the PreÅ¿s. But whoe're inÅ¿erted them, where lies the falÅ¿hood that has rais'd Å¿uch a DuÅ¿t, occaÅ¿ion'd Å¿o much Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour? Where? firÅ¿t, 'tis Å¿aid, Mr. <hi>Cairns</hi> declar'd (when he only by private DiÅ¿courÅ¿e endeavour'd to influence both City and Country) for the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> and the ProteÅ¿tant Religion. Again, 'tis Å¿aid, Mr. <hi>Cairns</hi> form'd the Multitude into Companies after the Gates were lock'd. He Å¿hould have Å¿aid, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd the Multitude of their IntereÅ¿t and Duty, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited them by Arguments and his own Concurrence, to purÅ¿ue with ConÅ¿tancy the good CauÅ¿e they had ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerouÅ¿ly eÅ¿pous'd. The truth of this paÅ¿Å¿age, as it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿pects Mr. <hi>Cairns,</hi> is this: He was out of the City when the Gates were lock'd, but arriving the next hour, and being mighty well pleas'd at the Action, and ReÅ¿olution of the Actors, but finding none of the grave Citizens with thoÅ¿e brisk Juniors, walk'd with them round the Walls and Gates of the City, anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them to perfiÅ¿t in their Vigour and ReÅ¿olution for the ProteÅ¿tant Religion, their Country, (and as far as he durÅ¿t whiÅ¿per it) for the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der God, Protector of both. Having left them in the Guard-HouÅ¿e, he made it his next buÅ¿ineÅ¿s to engage the Chief Citizens in the Å¿ame CauÅ¿e, Å¿ome of which accompany'd him to the Guard-HouÅ¿e the Å¿ame Night, joyn'd with him in giving Encouragement and Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to thoÅ¿e Juniors: He with others wrote that Night to Å¿everal Gentlemen in the Country, Å¿olliciting their Concurrence, and effectual AÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tance. He alÅ¿o DiÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours'd the BiÅ¿hop, but without effect. This Account I have from good hands, and do Appeal to any Com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>petent Judge, whether it do not juÅ¿tifie the attributing to Mr. <hi>Cairns</hi> the equivalent at leaÅ¿t, tho' not the Å¿ame, which the InÅ¿ertor, in Å¿omewhat a RuÅ¿tic Å¿tyle, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements him with. But Mr. <hi>Osborn</hi>'s Vindicator tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿cends the Reflector and all others on this head, and Å¿ays (<hi>pag.</hi> 26.) the ApologiÅ¿t aÅ¿cribes that to Mr. <hi>Cairns,</hi> as Å¿ingle, which he always own'd, was done by joynt-conÅ¿ent with others. AÅ¿cribes? where? Either in the words now vindicated, or no where: AÅ¿cribes? what? The Honour of that firÅ¿t Action. How is that poÅ¿Å¿ible, when nothing is attributed to him, till after locking the Gates, which Å¿ure was the commencement of that firÅ¿t Action? AÅ¿cribes to him as Å¿ingle? Strange! when all is aÅ¿crib'd to him in conjunction with a plurality. To give Mr. <hi>Cairns</hi> the firÅ¿t room of either Citizens or Gentlemen of chief Note, that firÅ¿t influenc'd, countenanc'd, and concur'd with thoÅ¿e Juniors men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd, is no more than his due; unleÅ¿s the meer lock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Gates engroÅ¿s all the Honour of that Action: But to infer hence, the Apology aÅ¿cribes that Honour to him as Å¿ingle, when it firÅ¿t makes him but one, (tho' a Chief and Leading Man) of the firÅ¿t Actors; and next mentions him relatively to a multitude, and both in part of one Period, is a new mode of deducing ConÅ¿equences I never before this heard of. Nor can I divine what the Gentleman infers his [as Å¿ingle] from, unleÅ¿s it be the Infertor's [in Å¿pecial Mr. <hi>Cairns</hi>] that is eÅ¿pecially, chiefly, or principally Mr. <hi>Cairns,</hi> I cannot elÅ¿e underÅ¿tand it: But then, how all, or any of theÅ¿e Synonimous terms can mean Mr. <hi>Cairns</hi> as Å¿ingle, excluÅ¿ive of all others, has puzl'd my Grammar and Logic, and Å¿ome Learned Men I have conÅ¿ulted about it; do therefore Å¿ubmit this inference, with the Explication I have now given of that Paragraph, to the unprejudic'd Reader; to whom I Å¿hall give no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther trouble in peruÅ¿ing what I had prepar'd in Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of my firÅ¿t Plea for C. <hi>Walker,</hi> being reliev'd in part by Mr. <hi>Osborn</hi>'s Vindication, and now Å¿uper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿eded by the true Narrative laÅ¿t week Printed. Shall therefore pitch next in <hi>pag. 9th.</hi> of the Reflections, and make bold to reckon with the Reflector for his LeeÅ¿ing-making. For, having quoted theÅ¿e words of the Apology [It will be found the IntereÅ¿t of Church and State, to Repeal the Act of <hi>Scandalum Magnatum,</hi> as it reÅ¿pects that Order, <hi>i. e.</hi> of BiÅ¿hops,] he thus Å¿ubjoyns, That is to Å¿ay, to aboliÅ¿h EpiÅ¿copacy, and Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude them from the HouÅ¿e of Lords.

            <p>My Second Plea for Col. <hi>Walker</hi> conÅ¿iÅ¿ted in this, <hi>i. e.</hi> That Mr. <hi>Walker</hi>'s EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿tic Superiours, and chiefly that very Reverend Prelate from <hi>Ireland,</hi> who receiv'd Col. <hi>Walker</hi> into his Coach at <hi>Barnet,</hi> and under whoÅ¿e Conduct he was obÅ¿erv'd to Compile his Narrative, are the Principal Authors of the MiÅ¿repreÅ¿entations charg'd on his Narrative. And do's the Reflector eÅ¿Å¿ay to diÅ¿prove it? No: he dares not deny it, nor Å¿o much as name the Plea; but diverts the Reader from taking any Notice of it, by a pleaÅ¿ant Story. The ApologiÅ¿t's Informer miÅ¿took it Å¿eems Sir <hi>Robert Cotton</hi>'s Coach for the Arch-BiÅ¿hop's; but the Reflector aÅ¿Å¿ures you, the Coach was Sir <hi>Robert Cotton</hi>'s, for (Å¿ays he) I Å¿aw it. And then (as if the Plea de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd all validity and Å¿trength from this CircumÅ¿tance) he Å¿ubjoyns very Comically [So that if Sir <hi>Robert Cotton</hi> be an Arch-BiÅ¿hop, he carries a Cloak over his Pall, and Å¿tands in need of a DiÅ¿penÅ¿ation for his Lay-Habit.

            <p>That firÅ¿t Plea conÅ¿iÅ¿ted of Å¿even Arguments, evin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing that Col. <hi>Walker</hi> neither is, nor can be Author of that Narrative. And here the Reflector neither af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> wrote it, nor denies the contrary; nor Å¿o much as bids at one Argument, to prove him at all the Author of it; how then does he attempt an eÅ¿cape from the ApologiÅ¿t? as in the preceding Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragraph he vainly hop'd to miÅ¿lead his Reader by a witty Story; Å¿o here he eÅ¿Å¿ays to divert him by this profound Query. Good Sir (Å¿ays the Reflector) do me the favour to tell me, do you think Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> was the Compiler of that Narrative which paÅ¿Å¿es un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Name, or no? Good Sir, do me the favour to tell me, whether it was Full Moon or Midnight, when you read my firÅ¿t Plea for Col. <hi>Walker,</hi> and firÅ¿t eight Pages of the Apology, both beÅ¿tow'd in evincing, he is not the Compiler of that Narrative? The Reflector proceeds in a very Logical, disjunctive diÅ¿tribution of his Query; If you do (Å¿ays he) as in the former part of your Paper you Å¿eem to inÅ¿inuate) why do you Calumniate him for the Errors and Imperfections in it? I Å¿hall anon Å¿alute one or two of the Reflector's [it Å¿eems,] as to the term Calumniate, in my Opinion (as the Reflector has it of the word Abdicate) that Verb implies a Å¿pontaneous act and Å¿omewhat more; no leÅ¿s than a cooperation of the two Supream Powers of the Rational Soul, the UnderÅ¿tanding, and Will, (a Calumny being confeÅ¿Å¿edly an heinous immorality) but an AÅ¿s, I mean of four Legs, can exert a Å¿ponta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous Act, I am Å¿ure the Reflector's HorÅ¿e could, if that Member of our Club was not miÅ¿taken, in faying, he run away with the Reflector's Rational Faculty, which I thought had been impoÅ¿Å¿ible, but for a wing'd PoÅ¿t from the higher or lower Regions. Were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the SuppoÅ¿ition as true as 'tis falÅ¿e, it could a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to no more than a MiÅ¿take or intellectual Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, not a Calumny; Å¿ince it neither had, nor ever Å¿hall have the conÅ¿entient act of the ApologiÅ¿t's Will. But you, O Reflector, have calumniated the Gramma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical, Logical, Moral Å¿enÅ¿e of the Apology, the SenÅ¿e and ReaÅ¿on of all, and your own among others that read it, in Å¿uggeÅ¿ting that it charges thoÅ¿e Errors and Imperfections in that Narrative on Mr. <hi>Walker,</hi> when its main Å¿cope is to prove the contrary. And whereas you inÅ¿inuate, that I Å¿eem to Å¿uÅ¿pect Mr. <hi>Walker</hi>'s SenÅ¿e or Courage; I tell you, of his Courage he has given Å¿ufficient demonÅ¿tration in <hi>page</hi> 24 of his Narrative, where he Å¿ays, he mounted one of the HorÅ¿es that were beaten to the Gates of <hi>Derry,</hi> and reliev'd Col. <hi>Murry,</hi> whom he Å¿aw Å¿urrounded with the

But to return to Mr. <hi>Walker,</hi> I Å¿hould be very Å¿orry he Å¿hould not prove a Man of SenÅ¿e too; for I hope to live to Å¿ee him Å¿it in the HouÅ¿e of Peers in <hi>WeÅ¿tminÅ¿ter</hi> or <hi>Dublin;</hi> and then every body would be apt to Å¿ay, that the King had Å¿poil'd a good Colonel, and an excellent Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of a GariÅ¿on, (I hate to Å¿ay, a Careful and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Store-keeper, and diÅ¿tributer of ProviÅ¿ions, as Mr. <hi>Osborn</hi>'s Vindicator, <hi>pag.</hi> 2. and 23.) to make an ill BiÅ¿hop, who would never be able to Å¿ecure the Church from being crucified between Popery and Presbytery, as â between two Thieves, if he did not better plead her CauÅ¿e than his Vindicator (that has Å¿carce the Soul of an InÅ¿ect) does his Narrative. Mean while, Reflector, give me leave to tell you, that if I had been Å¿o credulous as to have believ'd Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> compil'd that Narrative, theÅ¿e two Paragraphs of yours I have now Å¿cann'd, would have reliev'd my miÅ¿take, and confirm'd both Pleas of the Apology.

But leaving this to the PhiloÅ¿ophers, I cannot yield <hi>William Prynn</hi>'s Spirit reviv'd, till the Reflector has prov'd the Soul dies, which neither the Old Hereticks, nor <hi>Muggliton</hi> of late could ever prove. And though I Å¿hould grant all this, yea, that the Reflector had the Courage to look <hi>William Prynn</hi>'s grim, black, Å¿tern, terrible GhoÅ¿t in the Face, which no body will grant me, what then? What tricks did the Specter play? The Reflector tells us, he has Å¿currilouÅ¿ly revil'd by the ApologiÅ¿t's Pen, the Function and PerÅ¿on of the BiÅ¿hops. If the Reflector allude (as I think he muÅ¿t) to Mr. <hi>Prynn</hi>'s <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> on-BiÅ¿hop'd, which he challenges the two Arch-BiÅ¿hops of <hi>Canterbury</hi> and <hi>York</hi> to AnÅ¿wer, the Reflector has very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily reviv'd the memory of that Book: For tho' there be Å¿ome Arguments in it inconclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ive, there are many more, which as none (that I know of) have attempted to AnÅ¿wer, Å¿o Å¿hall I believe any ever will Å¿olidly when I Å¿ee it, not before.

And when Å¿uch Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rificat is procur'd (which will be a buÅ¿ineÅ¿s of Deliberation, becauÅ¿e momentous) it will no more prove the SuggeÅ¿tion a poÅ¿itive falÅ¿hood in the InÅ¿ertor, than your Interrogations and Search a poÅ¿itive Fallacy in you.

He further Å¿uÅ¿pects the ApologiÅ¿t to be a DiÅ¿ciple of <hi>Ignatius Loyola;</hi> which is monÅ¿trous Å¿trange: Sure he forgot the fag-end of his famous Paragraph, and the Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ide AdvertiÅ¿er his Friend. This frequent Å¿elf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contradiction in the Å¿ame Pamphlet, verifies the Old Saying, <hi>That Å¿ome men had need of a good Memory.</hi> However I'le be kind to the Reflector and AdvertiÅ¿er, and will Å¿ecure 'em from all Å¿u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿picion of JeÅ¿uitiÅ¿m. The ChriÅ¿tian World knows to its coÅ¿t, that BlaÅ¿phemous Seat entertains very Å¿ew Fops or <hi>IgnoramuÅ¿es;</hi> and tho' thoÅ¿e two Gentlemen, eÅ¿pecially the Reflector, may vie for Courage againÅ¿t SenÅ¿e and ReaÅ¿on, and his own ConÅ¿cience too, with the hardieÅ¿t of 'em; yet I that know them, durÅ¿t not venture his Conduct againÅ¿t a Novice of that Sect.

               <p>I am next to take notice of the credit Mr. <hi>Boyes</hi> has done the Apology, in borrowing from it the occaÅ¿ion and not a little of the matter of his three pag'd ConcluÅ¿ion to his Vindication of Mr. <hi>Osh.</hi> which the BookÅ¿eller has made a Six-Penny Book, as Å¿ome others have the Apology; when each paper at half the price wou'd better have Å¿erved the Authors ends, and I doubt not the BookÅ¿ellers too.

And here I wiÅ¿h he had Å¿topt, and reÅ¿erv'd for Å¿ome better occaÅ¿ion thoÅ¿e feeble Å¿uccours, which want Nerves and Spirits requiÅ¿it to the pretended Å¿ervice againÅ¿t the AdvertiÅ¿ement. their Center and Spring (I doubt) make but one point, tho' their Motion promiÅ¿e a different Period. Nor do's he beÅ¿tow a word in favour of the Apology, but what is depretiative of it, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretiative of his own performance; as by a brief Survey of particulars will appear. He wou'd have it believ'd, <hi>The Å¿harp AdvertiÅ¿ement would help off the firÅ¿t ImpreÅ¿Å¿ion of the Apology;</hi> whereas he ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did or might know, the firÅ¿t Edition Å¿old Å¿o faÅ¿t that in four days there was Printed a Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond.
